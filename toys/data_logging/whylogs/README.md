**Working.**

## Description

Examples of using [whylog](https://whylogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```text
Whylogs is an open source library for logging any kind of data. With whylogs, users are able to generate summaries of their datasets (called whylogs profiles) which they can use to:

1. Track changes in their dataset
2. Create data constraints to know whether their data looks the way it should
3. Quickly visualize key summary statistics about their datasets
```

## Quickstart

Requires the user to run this command first to initialize whylogs:

```shell
python -m whylogs.api.whylabs.session.why_init
```

## Credentials

## Notes

- This requires the user to use the whylabs "hub" address, not a local spun up server.  This is kind'a gross and I don't like it.  This is a minimal toy because of that.
