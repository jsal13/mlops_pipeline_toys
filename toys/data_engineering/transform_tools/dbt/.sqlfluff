# EXCLUDED RULES
# - `structure.column_order`: This excludes column structure to be able to do the "sort by" ids, numerics, etc.,
#   which is recommended by dbt.
# - `layout.cte_newline`: Because duckdb splits up queries by newlines, it is conveninent to exclude this newline
#   between CTEs.
# - `ambiguous.column_count`: Sqlfluff hates `select * ...`, but we use this frequently in dbt models.
