# MLOps Toys

A collection of MLOps Pipeline toys (templates for how to do things) for creating standard pipelines.

Most of these will be contained to a single folder.  The README in that folder will explain what the pipeline is.

## Making a New Toy

The only requirements are:

- The folder must contain a README made from `README.md.tmpl`.

- The folder must have one of the following (if applicable):

  - Dockerfiles or a docker-compose.yaml

  - Terraform-related files

  - Helm-related files

## To Create

Things I need to create or migrate.

- Trino (w/ Postgres + maybe minio)
- Grafana
- MLFlow basic
- Flyte (?) basic
- Prefect (?)
- Airflow (?)
